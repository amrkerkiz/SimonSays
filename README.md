# SimonSays
This game was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as using Jquery.

# Running the Project
In order to run the project, the index.html must be loaded, and after pressing a keyboard key, the game will start. Follow the flashed sequences to keep up with Simon!

# Project Functionalities
More specifically, this project showcases DOM manipulation, using jquery instead of plain vanilla javascript to manipulate these elements in a shorter and more consice and elegant way.
